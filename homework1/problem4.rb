#Whatâ€™s the difference between calling the method puts and returning a value from a method?

# The puts method will print a string to the screen or send strings to standard out, whereas the return method will return a value that will not be printed in the screen. Normally in Ruby the return method is not often used expecially since the last line of the code always automatically returns.
